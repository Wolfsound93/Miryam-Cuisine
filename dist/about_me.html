              <p>
                Growing up in Casablanca I have always been enchanted and drawn
                to the special seasonings and tastes of the Moroccan kitchen. My
                parents were from the north of Morocco so I have a great
                appreciation of Spanish cuisine and its influences as well as
                the finesse and elegance of French cuisine, from the French
                culture of Casablanca, and from my close family ties in Europe.
                After making aliyah to Israel I continued to blossom and learn.
                I embraced the specialties of Israel and the Mediterranean,
                refining them, and making them my own. I graduated with
                outstanding achievement from the famous Tadmor culinary
                institute where I gained a more professional approach and a
                keener sense of quality and creativity. As part of my personal
                development I was awarded an internship in Paris, France where I
                grabbed the opportunity to soak up all that I could and learn
                the tricks that make a dish elevated. I have also worked as food
                and beverage controller for the Hilton Tel Aviv hotel. This
                experience made it clear to me that I am at home professionally
                and personally suited to the culinary arts and the pleasure that
                they can bring to people, especially for celebrations, but even
                for just simple enjoyment. Today the Dallas area is my home and
                where people have come to know me and my abilities.
                Dallas.eater.com gave me recognition and acclaim for my
                sufganiyot (Donuts) during the Hanukkah season of which I am
                very proud. I offer customized cakes of different styles and
                designs at reasonable prices, to dessert table catering for
                private events, to hearty family meals targeted to your personal
                taste, be it Israeli or Moroccan. When it comes down to it, the
                quality and love put in to every thing I prepare makes me
                confident that I will earn a spot in you heart.
